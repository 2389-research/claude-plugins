# prbuddy

## Overview

prbuddy helps agents monitor PR health by checking CI status and triaging review comments. It fixes immediate issues and implements systematic prevention measures.

**Philosophy:** "Fix the acute issue AND prevent the class of error from recurring."

**Sub-skills:**
- `prbuddy:ci` - CI/workflow monitoring, failure diagnosis, fix + prevent
- `prbuddy:reviews` - Review comment triage, fix critical, create issues for nitpicks

## Prerequisites

### Required: gh CLI

Verify `gh` is installed and authenticated:

```bash
gh auth status
```

If not authenticated, run `gh auth login`.

**Required token scopes:**
- `repo` - Full control of private repositories (for PR operations)
- `read:org` - Read org membership (for issue creation in org repos)
- `workflow` - Update GitHub Action workflows (for CI operations)

To check scopes: `gh auth status` shows granted scopes.

### Required: gh-pr-review Extension

This extension is required for review comment handling:

```bash
gh extension install agynio/gh-pr-review
```

Verify installation:

```bash
gh pr-review --help
```

## When This Skill Applies

- "check my PR" / "PR status"
- "make this PR green"
- "fix my PR"
- "ready to merge"
- "handle PR feedback"
- "what's blocking my PR"

## Workflow

### Step 1: Detect PR

```bash
gh pr view --json number,title,body,url,headRefName,closingIssuesReferences
```

If no PR found for current branch, ask user:
- Create a PR: `gh pr create`
- Specify PR number: `/prbuddy 123`
- Specify PR URL

### Step 2: Check CI Status

```bash
gh pr checks --json name,state,bucket,link
```

**If any checks failed:** Route to `prbuddy:ci`

**If checks pending:** Report status and suggest checkpoint timing:
- "CI is still running. Check again before requesting review or declaring done."

**If all checks passed:** Continue to reviews

### Step 3: Check Review Comments

Route to `prbuddy:reviews`

### Step 4: Report Summary

```
PR #42 Health Check Complete

CI: ✓ All checks passing
Reviews:
  - 2 critical comments fixed (with prevention)
  - 3 issues created from nitpicks

Ready for: [next action - request review / merge / etc.]
```

## Routing Logic

### Keywords → Sub-Skill

**prbuddy:ci:**
- "CI failing", "workflow failed", "checks red"
- "build broken", "tests failing"
- "check CI status", "rerun workflows"

**prbuddy:reviews:**
- "review comments", "address feedback"
- "reviewer asked", "changes requested"
- "handle comments", "triage reviews"

**prbuddy (full orchestrator):**
- "check my PR", "PR health", "make PR green"
- "fix PR", "ready to merge"
- Ambiguous requests

### Routing Process

1. Analyze request for keywords
2. If clearly CI-related → `prbuddy:ci`
3. If clearly reviews-related → `prbuddy:reviews`
4. Otherwise → Run full orchestrator (CI then reviews)

## Error Handling

### No PR Found

```
No PR found for current branch 'feature-xyz'.

Options:
1. Create a PR: gh pr create
2. Specify PR number: /prbuddy 123
3. Specify PR URL: /prbuddy https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
```

### gh-pr-review Extension Missing

```
The gh-pr-review extension is required for review comment handling.

Install it:
  gh extension install agynio/gh-pr-review

Then retry: /prbuddy:reviews
```

### gh Not Authenticated

```
GitHub CLI is not authenticated.

Run: gh auth login

Then retry: /prbuddy
```

### Fork-Based PRs

This skill assumes write access to the PR branch. For fork-based PRs:
- You may not have push access to the source branch
- Protected branch rules may prevent direct pushes
- Consider creating a fix branch and opening a separate PR

**Workaround:** Ask the user to push changes manually or grant write access.

### Dry-Run Mode

To preview changes without committing, tell the agent:
- "Show me what you would fix, but don't commit"
- "Dry-run mode" or "preview only"

The agent will analyze and report proposed fixes without making changes.
