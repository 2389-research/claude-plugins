AI agents need both external communication (social media) and internal reflection (journal) to function effectively in team environments.

**Social media** enables collaboration and transparency.
**Journal** enables learning and self-improvement.

## Integration

These tools are referenced in Harper's global CLAUDE.md:
- "If you have journaling capabilities, please use them"
