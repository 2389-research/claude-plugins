## What This Plugin Provides

### Main Skill: `landing-page-design`

A comprehensive workflow for building landing pages worth $50-100. The skill enforces unique design direction through the **Vibe Discovery** process, preventing the generic "AI-slop" look.

## Quick Example

```
User: "Build a landing page for my productivity app"

Claude: Before writing any code, let's run Vibe Discovery.

Q1: What's one real-world place or object this brand would be?
Q2: What's the ONE emotion someone should feel in the first 3 seconds?
Q3: Pick TWO unexpected influences to collide:
Q4: What should this page NEVER be mistaken for?

[After answers, Claude creates a unique Vibe Spec and builds a distinctive page]
```

## The Problem This Solves

AI-generated landing pages converge on the same patterns:
- Purple gradients
- Inter/Roboto fonts
- Lucide icons
- Generic bento grids
- Same animations everywhere

This plugin forces Claude to create a **unique aesthetic direction** for every project.

## Key Features

### Vibe Discovery Process
- 4 context questions that generate unique direction
- Color/typography/layout invention (not lookup)
- Anti-convergence rules to prevent generic output
- Freshness check before coding

### The 50% Rule
Half your effort goes to the hero section. It's the social media preview, the first impression, the hook.

### Anti-AI-Slop Principles
- **Fonts**: Kill Inter/Roboto. Use Newsreader, Playfair Display, Clash Display, etc.
- **Icons**: Avoid Lucide. Use Iconify Solar, Heroicons, Phosphor.
- **Colors**: No purple gradients. Derive from real-world references.
- **Layouts**: Break the grid. Overlapping elements, diagonal sections, asymmetry.

### Animation Vocabulary
Full animation system for entrances, continuous effects, interactions, and decorative elements.

## Section Composition

1. **Hero** - The make-or-break element (50% of effort)
2. **Features/Benefits** - Bento grids, alternating rows, icon grids
3. **Social Proof** - Logo marquee, testimonials, stats
4. **How It Works** - Numbered steps, timeline, flowchart
5. **Pricing** - Tier comparison with recommended highlight
6. **Final CTA** - Repeat value prop, single focused action
7. **Footer** - Navigation, social, legal
