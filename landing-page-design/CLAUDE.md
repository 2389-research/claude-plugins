# Landing Page Design Plugin

## Overview

This plugin provides a comprehensive workflow for creating high-converting, visually distinctive landing pages. It emphasizes the "anti-AI-slop" approach - avoiding the generic patterns that plague AI-generated designs.

## Skills Included

| Skill | Trigger | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| landing-page-design | "landing page", "marketing page", "product launch page", "SaaS homepage" | Full landing page design workflow with Vibe Discovery |

## Core Philosophy

### The Problem This Solves

AI-generated landing pages tend to converge on the same patterns:
- Purple gradients everywhere
- Inter/Roboto fonts
- Lucide icons
- Generic bento grids
- Same animation patterns

This skill forces UNIQUE design direction for every project through the **Vibe Discovery** process.

### The Vibe Discovery Mandate

**BEFORE any code, you MUST:**
1. Ask the 4 context questions
2. Synthesize a unique aesthetic direction
3. Write out a Vibe Spec
4. Pass the Freshness Check

No shortcuts. No "I'll figure out the style as I go."

## Key Patterns

### The 50% Rule
Spend half your time on the hero section. It's the social media preview, the first impression, the hook. Everything else flows from the hero.

### Anti-Convergence Rules
1. **No hex code memory** - Generate colors fresh from reference
2. **Font rotation required** - Can't reuse display fonts across projects
3. **Collision must show** - Both influences from Q3 must be visible
4. **Wildcard is mandatory** - Every vibe needs one "doesn't fit" element
5. **Name it** - Unnamed vibes become generic

### Section Order
1. Hero (primary focus)
2. Features/Benefits
3. Social Proof
4. How It Works
5. Pricing (if applicable)
6. Final CTA
7. Footer

## Anti-AI-Slop Checklist

**Fonts to AVOID:**
- Inter
- Roboto
- Open Sans
- Lato

**Icons to AVOID:**
- Lucide (overused)

**Colors to AVOID:**
- Purple gradients
- The "Stripe palette"
- Generic blue-to-purple

**Use INSTEAD:**
- Fonts: Newsreader, Playfair Display, Clash Display, Outfit, Manrope, Satoshi
- Icons: Iconify Solar, Heroicons, Phosphor
- Colors: Derive from the real-world reference in Q1

## Animation Vocabulary

**Continuous:** marquee, beam, pulse, float, rotate

**Interactive:** hover-lift, hover-glow, hover-reveal, click-ripple

**Decorative:** grid lines, noodles/curves, gradient orbs, grain texture

## Implementation Phases

1. **Research & Collect** - Gather references, choose fonts/icons/colors
2. **Hero Development** - Build and iterate until distinctive
3. **Section Build-Out** - Add sections one at a time
4. **Polish** - Responsive, performance, accessibility
5. **Presentation** - Cover screenshot with infinity canvas layout
