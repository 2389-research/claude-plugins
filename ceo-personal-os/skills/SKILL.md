# CEO Personal Operating System

## Overview

Build a **reflection system**, not a task manager. This is a private, single-user operating system for executives that combines thoughtful frameworks with coaching-style prompts. Output should feel like an executive coach, chief of staff, and accountability partner - calm, direct, insightful.

**Core principle:** Clarity over productivity theater. No hustle culture. No corporate jargon.

## When to Use

- User wants a "personal operating system" or "personal productivity system"
- Building annual review or goal-setting system for an executive
- Creating reflection frameworks for a CEO/founder
- User mentions frameworks: Gustin, Ferriss Lifestyle Costing, Vivid Vision, Life Map
- User mentions Bill Campbell, Trillion Dollar Coach, or coaching principles
- User wants to develop their people or build better teams
- User mentions startup failure patterns, "Why Startups Fail", or Eisenmann
- User is evaluating venture health or considering when to pivot/quit

### 5. Bill Campbell Coaching Principles

Credit: "Trillion Dollar Coach" by Eric Schmidt, Jonathan Rosenberg, Alan Eagle

**Core Principles:**

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **It's The People** | Your top priority is the well-being and success of your people. Support, respect, trust. |
| **Work The Team, Then The Problem** | When facing any problem, first ensure the right team is in place. |
| **Only Coach The Coachable** | Look for honesty, humility, perseverance, and openness to learning. |
| **The Lovely Reset** | Start meetings with personal check-ins (weekend, family). Creates better decisions. |
| **Free-Form Listening** | Full attention, Socratic questions, no distractions. |
| **Team First** | Commit to the cause, not just personal success. |

**Four Characteristics to Seek in People:**
1. **Smart** - Ability to make "far analogies" across domains
2. **Hard Work** - Willingness to put in the effort
3. **Integrity** - Honest with others and themselves
4. **Grit** - Passion and perseverance to get back up

**The Campbell Yardstick:**
> "I count up how many people I've helped become great leaders. That's how I measure success."

Include in quarterly reviews:
- Who did I develop this quarter?
- Who needs more support?
- Is the right team in place for each challenge?
- Am I creating psychological safety?

**The "What Next?" Framework (Post-50):**
- Be creative - your most creative years are ahead
- Don't be a dilettante - have accountability in everything
- Find people with vitality - often younger
- Apply your unique gifts
- Don't waste time worrying about the future

### 6. Eisenmann Startup Failure Patterns

Credit: "Why Startups Fail" by Tom Eisenmann (Harvard Business School)

**The Six Failure Patterns:**

| Pattern | Stage | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Bad Bedfellows** | Early | Wrong team, investors, or partners sink the venture despite a good idea |
| **False Starts** | Early | "Fail fast" taken too far—launching before researching customer needs |
| **False Positives** | Early | Early adopter success misleads about mainstream market demand |
| **Speed Traps** | Late | Hypergrowth leads to disaster as CAC rises and margins erode |
| **Help Wanted** | Late | Financing risk + management gaps during rapid scaling |
| **Cascading Miracles** | Late | Too many "do or die" things must go right—betting on improbable outcomes |

**The Diamond-and-Square Framework:**

Use this to assess venture health. All eight elements must align:

*Diamond (Opportunity):*
- **Customer Value Proposition** - Strong, unmet need + sustainable differentiation
- **Technology & Operations** - Can you build and deliver it?
- **Marketing** - Can you reach customers cost-effectively?
- **Profit Formula** - Unit economics, LTV/CAC > 3, path to break-even

*Square (Resources):*
- **Founders** - Right skills, experience, temperament (not too headstrong or tentative)
- **Team** - Balance of attitude and skill
- **Investors** - Aligned interests, patient capital, value-add beyond money
- **Partners** - Reliable strategic relationships

**Four Types of Entrepreneurial Risk:**

1. **Demand Risk** - Will customers actually want this?
2. **Technological Risk** - Can we build what we envision?
3. **Execution Risk** - Can we attract and manage the right people?
4. **Financing Risk** - Can we raise capital when we need it?

**Key Metrics to Monitor:**

| Metric | Target | Warning Sign |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| Unit Economics | Positive gross profit per unit | Losing money on every transaction |
| LTV/CAC Ratio | > 3.0 | Below 1.0 = doomed |
| Cash Runway | 12-18 months | Less than 6 months |
| Customer Acquisition Cost | Stable or declining | Rising faster than LTV |

**Running on Empty Pattern:**

The hardest decision: When to quit vs. persevere. Warning signs:
- Burning capital investors will never recover
- Team members investing time in doomed venture
- Persisting past point where turnaround odds are minuscule
- "Hope springs eternal" rationalization overriding data

**Include in Quarterly Reviews:**
- Which failure patterns might we be vulnerable to right now?
- Is our Diamond-Square alignment strong?
- What are our current risk levels across the four types?
- Are we tracking toward our key metrics targets?
- If we're struggling, is this a smart bet that hasn't paid off, or are we Running on Empty?

## Additional Frameworks to Include

- **CEO Energy Management**: Track energy, not just time
- **Personal Board of Directors**: 5 advisors for key life areas
- **Regret Minimization**: Bezos framework for decisions
- **Leverage vs. Effort**: Where does input create disproportionate output?

## Interview Script Requirements

Coach-style questions (non-judgmental, reflective):

```markdown
## Past Year Reflection
- "Tell me about the last year -- highlights first."
- "What drained you the most?"
- "Where did you avoid hard decisions?"
- "What are you proud of that no one else sees?"
- "What would you not repeat under any circumstances?"
- "If this year repeated ten times, would you be satisfied?"
```

```markdown
## Identity & Values
- "What do you believe that most people don't?"
- "When do you feel most alive?"
- "What would you do if you couldn't fail?"
- "Who do you want to become?"
```

```markdown
## Future Self Interview
- "It's 10 years from now. Describe your day."
- "What did you have to give up to get here?"
- "What do you wish you had started sooner?"
- "What advice would future-you give present-you?"
```

```markdown
## Team & People Reflection (Campbell-style)
- "Who are you most proud of developing this year?"
- "Who on your team needs more support right now?"
- "Is the right team in place for your biggest challenge?"
- "What keeps you up at night about your people?"
- "Who have you helped become a great leader?"
- "Are you creating psychological safety? How do you know?"
- "Who do you need to have a hard conversation with?"
```

```markdown
## Failure Pattern Detection (Eisenmann-style)
- "Which of the six failure patterns might you be vulnerable to right now?"
- "Is your Diamond (opportunity) and Square (resources) aligned?"
- "Are you chasing false positives from early adopters?"
- "Are you growing faster than your unit economics support?"
- "Do you have the right senior team for this stage of growth?"
- "How many 'miracles' need to happen for your vision to succeed?"
- "Are you persisting past the point of reasonable hope?"
- "What would make you decide to pull the plug?"
- "If you shut down today, would that be a smart bet that didn't pay off, or a failure to face reality?"
```

## Review Cadence Specifications

### Daily Check-in (5 minutes max)
- Energy level (1-10)
- One meaningful win
- One friction point

## Required Placeholders

Every template MUST include these for personalization:
- `[YOUR COMPANY]`
- `[YOUR ROLE]`
- `[YOUR STAGE OF LIFE]`
- `[YOUR CURRENT PRIORITIES]`
- `[YOUR PRIMARY RELATIONSHIP]`

## Memory & Pattern Extraction

The `memory.md` file must:
- Store extracted insights from uploaded documents
- Track repeated themes across years
- Note recurring goals (achieved/not achieved)
- Identify blind spots and patterns
- Generate "Executive Pattern Summary" when documents uploaded

When user uploads to `uploads/`:
1. Summarize the document
2. Extract patterns (goals, failures, strengths, themes)
3. Append key insights to `memory.md`
4. Reference in future reviews

## Tone Requirements

**DO:**
- Calm, executive-level
- Direct and clear
- Insightful questions
- Psychologically safe
- Simple explanations

**DON'T:**
- Hustle culture ("crush it", "grind")
- Therapy speak ("holding space")
- Corporate jargon ("synergize")
- Productivity porn ("10x your output")
- Overwhelming complexity

## README Requirements

The README.md must explain:
1. How to use the system daily (1 paragraph)
2. How to use weekly (1 paragraph)
3. How to use quarterly (1 paragraph)
4. How to use annually (1 paragraph)
5. How to personalize in under 15 minutes
6. How to upload past documents
7. Quick-start for day one

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] All folders and files created per structure
- [ ] All 6 frameworks documented with credits (Gustin, Ferriss, Robbins, Lieberman, Campbell, Eisenmann)
- [ ] All 5 interview scripts with coaching questions (including Team & People, Failure Pattern Detection)
- [ ] All 4 review cadences with templates
- [ ] All goal files (1/3/10 year) populated
- [ ] memory.md initialized with pattern tracking structure
- [ ] Placeholders throughout for personalization
- [ ] README explains daily/weekly/quarterly/annual usage
- [ ] Tone is calm, direct, insightful throughout
- [ ] No generic productivity advice substituted for specified frameworks
- [ ] Campbell Yardstick question in quarterly reviews ("Who have I developed?")
- [ ] Eisenmann failure pattern check in quarterly reviews ("Which patterns are we vulnerable to?")

## Review Templates Required

Each review folder MUST contain a template file:
- `reviews/daily/template.md` - 5-question daily check-in
- `reviews/weekly/template.md` - Strategic weekly review
- `reviews/quarterly/template.md` - Goal & alignment review
- `reviews/annual/template.md` - Comprehensive annual review

These are the TEMPLATES users copy to create dated entries.

## Assumptions to Document

Include an `assumptions.md` section in README.md documenting:
- User is a CEO/founder/executive (non-technical is fine)
- Single user, private system (not shared)
- Uses markdown-compatible editor (Obsidian, VS Code, etc.)
- 15-30 min/week commitment minimum
- Annual review takes 4-6 hours

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "I'll use Eisenhower instead" | Skill specifies Gustin, Ferriss, Robbins, Lieberman. Use those. |
| "Memory.md is optional" | It's required for pattern extraction across years |
| "Daily check-in is too simple" | 5 minutes max is intentional. Simplicity is the feature. |
| "I'll add more productivity frameworks" | Less is more. Four specific frameworks, not twelve generic ones. |
| "The tone can be more motivational" | Calm and direct. No hustle culture. |
| "Templates aren't needed in review folders" | Each review folder needs its template.md |

## Red Flags - STOP

If you catch yourself doing any of these:

- Using generic frameworks (Eisenhower, 80/20) instead of specified ones
- Creating a task manager instead of a reflection system
- Skipping memory.md or uploads structure
- Using hustle culture language
- Making it feel like a productivity app
- Substituting your own frameworks for the required ones
- Skipping template.md files in review folders

**All of these mean: Re-read this skill. Follow the specifications.**
