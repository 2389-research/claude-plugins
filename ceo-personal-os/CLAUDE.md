# CEO Personal OS Plugin

## Overview

This plugin provides a methodology for building a personal operating system for CEOs, founders, and executives. The focus is on reflection and clarity, not productivity theater.

## Skills Included

### ceo-personal-os (Main Skill)

Auto-detects when someone wants to:
- Build a personal operating system
- Create annual review frameworks
- Set up goal-setting systems
- Implement executive coaching frameworks

## Key Patterns

### This is a Reflection System, Not a Task Manager

The core principle is clarity over productivity. Output should feel like an executive coach - calm, direct, insightful.

### Four Required Frameworks

1. **Dr. Anthony Gustin Annual Review** - Wins, lessons, relationships, energy patterns
2. **Tim Ferriss Ideal Lifestyle Costing** - Dreamlines with costs, TMI calculation
3. **Tony Robbins Vivid Vision** - Present-tense 3-year future description
4. **Alex Lieberman Life Map** - 6 domains: Career, Relationships, Health, Meaning, Finances, Fun

### Review Cadences

| Cadence | Time | Focus |
|---------|------|-------|
| Daily | 5 min max | Energy, one win, one friction, one priority |
| Weekly | 30-45 min | Needle movers vs. noise |
| Quarterly | 2-3 hours | Goal progress and alignment |
| Annual | 4-6 hours | Full reflection + all frameworks |

### Required Structure

```
ceo-personal-os/
├── frameworks/          # 4 specific frameworks with credits
├── interviews/          # Coach-style question scripts
├── reviews/             # Templates for each cadence
├── goals/               # 1/3/10 year horizons
├── uploads/             # Past reviews for pattern extraction
├── memory.md            # Extracted patterns and insights
└── principles.md        # Core operating principles
```

### Memory & Pattern Extraction

The `memory.md` file tracks:
- Repeated themes across years
- Recurring goals (achieved/not achieved)
- Blind spots and patterns
- Executive pattern summary from uploaded documents

## Tone Requirements

**DO:** Calm, executive-level, direct, clear, insightful questions, psychologically safe

**DON'T:** Hustle culture ("crush it"), therapy speak ("holding space"), corporate jargon ("synergize"), productivity porn ("10x your output")

## Red Flags

- Using generic frameworks (Eisenhower, 80/20) instead of specified ones
- Creating a task manager instead of a reflection system
- Skipping memory.md or uploads structure
- Using hustle culture language
- Substituting your own frameworks for the required ones

## Development Notes

When building a CEO Personal OS:
1. Use TodoWrite to track every folder/file
2. Include all 4 frameworks with proper credits
3. Generate coach-style interview questions
4. Create templates in each review folder
5. Initialize memory.md for pattern tracking
6. Keep tone calm and direct throughout
