## Key Patterns

### This is a Reflection System, Not a Task Manager

The core principle is clarity over productivity. Output should feel like an executive coach - calm, direct, insightful.

### Nine Required Frameworks

1. **Dr. Anthony Gustin Annual Review** - Wins, lessons, relationships, energy patterns
2. **Tim Ferriss Ideal Lifestyle Costing** - Dreamlines with costs, TMI calculation
3. **Tony Robbins Vivid Vision** - Present-tense 3-year future description
4. **Alex Lieberman Life Map** - 6 domains: Career, Relationships, Health, Meaning, Finances, Fun
5. **Bill Campbell Coaching Principles** - People-first leadership from "Trillion Dollar Coach"
6. **Tom Eisenmann Startup Failure Patterns** - Six patterns that kill ventures from "Why Startups Fail"
7. **Jim Collins Good to Great** - Level 5 Leadership, Hedgehog Concept, Flywheel, Stockdale Paradox
8. **Dan Martell Buy Back Your Time** - Buyback Principle, DRIP Matrix, Pain Line, Production Quadrant
9. **Michael Gerber E-Myth** - Work ON not IN, Entrepreneur/Manager/Technician, Franchise Prototype

### Campbell Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| It's The People | Top priority is well-being and success of your people |
| Work The Team, Then The Problem | Ensure right team is in place before tackling problems |
| Only Coach The Coachable | Look for honesty, humility, perseverance, openness to learning |
| The Lovely Reset | Start meetings with personal check-ins |
| Team First | Commit to the cause, not just personal success |

**The Campbell Yardstick:** "I count up how many people I've helped become great leaders."

**Four Characteristics to Seek:** Smart (far analogies), Hard Work, Integrity, Grit

### Eisenmann Failure Patterns

| Pattern | Stage | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Bad Bedfellows | Early | Wrong team, investors, or partners |
| False Starts | Early | Launching before researching customer needs |
| False Positives | Early | Early adopter success misleads about mainstream |
| Speed Traps | Late | Hypergrowth leads to rising CAC and eroding margins |
| Help Wanted | Late | Financing risk + management gaps during scaling |
| Cascading Miracles | Late | Too many "do or die" things must go right |

**Diamond-and-Square Framework:** Assess alignment of Opportunity (CVP, Tech/Ops, Marketing, Profit Formula) and Resources (Founders, Team, Investors, Partners)

**Key Metrics:** Unit Economics, LTV/CAC > 3, Cash Runway 12-18 months

### Review Cadences

| Cadence | Time | Focus |
|---------|------|-------|
| Daily | 5 min max | Energy, one win, one friction, one priority |
| Weekly | 30-45 min | Needle movers vs. noise |
| Quarterly | 2-3 hours | Goal progress and alignment |
| Annual | 4-6 hours | Full reflection + all frameworks |

### Required Structure

```
ceo-personal-os/
├── frameworks/          # 9 specific frameworks with credits
├── interviews/          # 8 coach-style question scripts
├── reviews/             # Templates for each cadence
├── goals/               # 1/3/10 year horizons
├── uploads/             # Past reviews for pattern extraction
├── memory.md            # Extracted patterns and insights
└── principles.md        # Core operating principles
```

### Memory & Pattern Extraction

The `memory.md` file tracks:
- Repeated themes across years
- Recurring goals (achieved/not achieved)
- Blind spots and patterns
- Executive pattern summary from uploaded documents

## Tone Requirements

**DO:** Calm, executive-level, direct, clear, insightful questions, psychologically safe

**DON'T:** Hustle culture ("crush it"), therapy speak ("holding space"), corporate jargon ("synergize"), productivity porn ("10x your output")

## Red Flags

- Using generic frameworks (Eisenhower, 80/20) instead of specified ones
- Creating a task manager instead of a reflection system
- Skipping memory.md or uploads structure
- Using hustle culture language
- Substituting your own frameworks for the required ones

## Development Notes

When building a CEO Personal OS:
1. Use TodoWrite to track every folder/file
2. Include all 6 frameworks with proper credits (Gustin, Ferriss, Robbins, Lieberman, Campbell, Eisenmann)
3. Generate coach-style interview questions (including Team & People reflection, Failure Pattern Detection)
4. Create templates in each review folder
5. Initialize memory.md for pattern tracking
6. Keep tone calm and direct throughout
7. Include Campbell Yardstick question in quarterly reviews: "Who have I developed?"
8. Include Eisenmann failure pattern check in quarterly reviews: "Which patterns am I vulnerable to?"
9. Add team/people reflection for executives who manage others
10. Add Diamond-Square alignment review for founder/CEOs
