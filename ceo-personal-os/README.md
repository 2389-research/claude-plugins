## Quick example

Start with: "Help me build a personal operating system"

The skill generates a complete structure:
```
ceo-personal-os/
├── frameworks/          # 10 specific frameworks
├── interviews/          # 10 coach-style question scripts
├── reviews/             # Daily/weekly/quarterly/annual
├── goals/               # 1/3/10 year horizons
├── memory.md            # Pattern extraction
└── principles.md        # Core operating principles
```

## Core principle

Clarity over productivity theater. No hustle culture. No corporate jargon. The output should feel like talking to an executive coach who is calm, direct, and asks good questions.

## Review cadences

| Cadence | Time | Focus |
|---------|------|-------|
| Daily | 5 min | Energy + one win + one friction |
| Weekly | 30-45 min | What moved the needle? |
| Quarterly | 2-3 hours | Goal alignment check |
| Annual | 4-6 hours | Full Gustin-style reflection |
