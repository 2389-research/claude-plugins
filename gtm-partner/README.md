# GTM Partner

Strategic go-to-market consultant for validated business ideas.

## What It Does

Transforms a validated idea into actionable GTM strategy with:
- Channel recommendations based on audience and budget
- Verified naming options (domain availability checked)
- Pricing strategy tailored to your specific audience
- Outreach templates ready to copy-paste
- Blog post outlines in authentic voice

## Philosophy

1. **Understand** before recommending
2. **Recommend** before generating
3. **Generate** only what's approved

This is a strategic partner, not a content factory.

## The Flow

### Phase 1: Gather Context
One question at a time, confirms:
- Target audience
- Value proposition
- First milestone + goal
- Timeline
- Pricing strategy (with deep analysis)
- Budget
- Existing assets

### Phase 2: Recommend Channels
Presents 2-4 channels with rationale, explains what NOT to recommend and why.

### Phase 2.5: Context Summary (Mandatory)
Creates a checkpoint webpage with all decisions before generating assets. Includes verified naming options with domain availability.

### Phase 3: Generate Assets
Only generates what was approved:
- Product brief
- Naming + domains
- Pricing strategy
- Landing page updates
- Outreach templates
- Blog post outline

### Phase 4: Deliver
Consolidates everything into `GTM-STRATEGY.html` with actionable next steps.

## Key Features

### Pricing Analysis Framework
Never defaults to generic "$20-30/mo". Analyzes:
- Who pays and how (individual vs company, annual vs monthly)
- What they already pay for similar tools
- Value delivered (quantified)
- Multiple business models with trade-offs

### Milestone Clarity
Shows the reasoning chain:
- Goal → Optimizing For → Approach → Success Metric
- Different asks have different relationship costs
- Escalation path: Feedback → Quote → Mention → Write-up

### Network Leverage
For 2389 products, factors in existing network:
- Who do we know close to this problem?
- Warm intros before cold outreach
- Specific asks for each person

### Harper Writing Style
Long-form copy (outreach, blogs) uses authentic voice:
- Conversational, not corporate
- Opens with personal narrative
- No marketing speak
- Self-deprecating humor allowed

## Output Files
