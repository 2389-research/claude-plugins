# Quaker Business Practice Plugin

## Overview

Decision-making skills emulating Quaker business practices - seeking unity through discernment rather than consensus through debate.

## Skills Included

### Main Skill: qbp

Routes to specific sub-skills based on context:
- User has stake/perspective → `qbp:gathered`
- Needs parallel deep analysis → `qbp:clearness`
- Weighty question → `qbp:discernment`

### Sub-Skills

- **qbp:discernment** - Internal deliberation with multiple voices for weighty questions
- **qbp:clearness** - Multi-agent committee for parallel deep analysis
- **qbp:gathered** - Participatory discernment where user joins the process

**When to invoke:**
- Facing weighty decisions with ethical implications
- Multiple valid approaches exist and trade-offs matter
- User has a stake or perspective (not just a question)
- Complex analysis would benefit from multiple specialized perspectives
- Quick answers would paper over real tensions

## Patterns

### Core Philosophy

- **Unity over consensus** - Seek genuine alignment, not vote-counting
- **Discernment over debate** - Listen for truth, don't argue positions
- **Silence is valuable** - Pausing between voices lets insights emerge
- **Tensions named, not hidden** - If unity doesn't emerge, say so clearly

### Quaker Principles Applied

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Sense of the meeting | Clerk discerns where unity lies |
| Speaking once | Each voice/agent speaks once, then listens |
| Standing aside | "I disagree but won't block" |
| Blocking | Rare - only for core principle violations |
| Way opens | Recognize when clarity emerges vs. forcing |
