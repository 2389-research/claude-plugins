# Clerk Patterns: Synthesis and Discernment

How the clerk role works across all QBP skills.

## The Clerk's Job

The clerk is not a chairperson. The clerk:
- **Listens** for where truth lies across all voices
- **Discerns** the sense of the meeting (not calculates it)
- **Articulates** what unity might look like
- **Tests** whether the articulation lands ("Does this capture it?")

## Synthesis Process

After all voices have spoken:

### 1. Sit with what's been said

Don't rush. The clerk's first job is to receive, not produce.

### 2. Listen for patterns

- Where do voices align?
- Where is there genuine tension?
- Where are voices saying the same thing differently?
- Where is one voice surfacing something others missed?

### 3. Distinguish tension types

| Type | Meaning | Response |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Surface tension** | Different words, same insight | Articulate the shared insight |
| **Complementary tension** | Different facets of same truth | Integrate both facets |
| **Real tension** | Genuinely incompatible positions | Name it, don't paper over |

### 4. Articulate the sense

Frame what you're sensing, not what you're deciding:

> "Listening to everyone, I sense unity around X. The concern about Y was raised but doesn't block - it's noted as something to monitor. Does this capture it?"

### 5. Test the articulation

The clerk's articulation is a proposal, not a pronouncement. Invite correction:
- "Does this land right?"
- "Am I missing something?"
- "Is there a voice that hasn't been heard?"

## Handling Stand-Asides

When a voice stands aside:

1. **Acknowledge it explicitly:** "The security perspective notes concern about X but doesn't block."
2. **Don't minimize it:** Standing aside is meaningful, not a problem to solve.
3. **Include it in the record:** The decision carries this noted reservation.

## Handling Blocks

When a voice blocks:

1. **Stop immediately:** Don't try to proceed around a block.
2. **Understand it:** "Help me understand what principle this violates."
3. **Escalate appropriately:**
   - Internal discernment: Block goes to user with explanation
   - Clearness: Block surfaces tension for user to resolve
   - Gathered: Block pauses process for group attention

## When Way Doesn't Open

If unity doesn't emerge:

1. **Don't force it:** Premature unity is worse than no unity.
2. **Name the tension:** Articulate clearly where alignment can't be found.
3. **Identify what might help:**
   - More information?
   - A different framing of the question?
   - Time to season?
4. **Escalate with clarity:** Give the user/group actionable options.

## Clerk Phrases

**For opening:**
- "Let's discern together..."
- "The question before us is..."
- "We're seeking clarity on..."

**For transitions:**
- "Let's sit with what's been shared."
- "Before synthesizing, I want to make sure all voices are heard."

**For synthesis:**
- "Listening to everyone, I sense..."
- "Unity seems to be emerging around..."
- "The common thread I'm hearing is..."

**For testing:**
- "Does this capture it?"
- "Am I missing something?"
- "Does this land right?"

**For stand-asides:**
- "[Voice] notes [concern] but doesn't block."
- "This proceeds with [reservation] acknowledged."

**For no unity:**
- "I'm not sensing clear unity yet."
- "The tension between X and Y isn't resolving."
- "Way isn't opening. We may need..."
