# Quaker Business Practice: Core Principles

These principles underlie all QBP skills. They are not negotiable shortcuts - they are the practice.

## The Six Principles

### 1. Sense of the Meeting

The clerk discerns where unity lies - not counting votes, not averaging positions, not finding compromise. Unity emerges from listening for where truth lies across all perspectives.

**Key insight:** A 4-1 vote tells you nothing. What matters is whether the one has surfaced something the four haven't considered.

### 2. Waiting in Silence

Pausing between voices lets insights emerge. Rushing to fill silence kills discernment. The space between contributions is where integration happens.

**Implementation:** After each voice speaks, pause. Don't rush to the next voice or to synthesis. Let things settle.

### 3. Speaking Only Once

Each perspective speaks once to the matter, then listens. This forces depth - you can't react, you have to say what you really mean. It also ensures all voices are heard before anyone dominates.

**Discipline:** If you've spoken, you're done. Listen to what comes after. If new insight emerges, it informs the synthesis, not a second speech.

### 4. Standing Aside

"I wouldn't do this myself, but I won't block the group from proceeding." Standing aside is honest disagreement that doesn't prevent action. It's noted and honored.

**Key distinction:** Standing aside is NOT reluctant agreement. It's genuine disagreement paired with trust in the group's discernment.

### 5. Blocking

A voice can stop proceedings if something violates core principles. This is rare and weighty. Blocking says: "This isn't just my preference - this would cause real harm."

**Use sparingly:** Blocking is not for disagreement. It's for preventing harm. Overuse destroys the practice.

### 6. Way Opens (or Doesn't)

Sometimes clarity emerges naturally - "way opens." Sometimes it doesn't, and forcing a decision would be premature. Recognizing the difference is discernment.

**When way doesn't open:** The matter is laid aside. More information is needed. The question may need reframing. This is not failure - it's wisdom.

## The Anti-Principles

Things that look like Quaker practice but aren't:

| Looks like | Actually is | Why it fails |
|------------|-------------|--------------|
| Everyone gets a turn | Speaking only if led | Forced contribution ≠ discernment |
| Consensus | Unity | Consensus is political; unity is spiritual |
| Compromise | Integration | Compromise loses truth; integration honors it |
| Voting then accepting | Standing aside | Vote-losers aren't standing aside; they're outvoted |
| Quick agreement | Rushing past difficulty | Premature unity is fake unity |
| Debate then decide | Discernment | Debate is adversarial; discernment is collaborative |

## Applying These Principles

These principles apply whether participants are:
- Internal voices (qbp:discernment)
- Spawned agents (qbp:clearness)
- Agents + user together (qbp:gathered)

The implementation differs. The principles don't.
