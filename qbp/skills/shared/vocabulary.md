# Quaker Business Practice: Vocabulary

Shared terminology across all QBP skills. Use these terms consistently.

## Roles

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Clerk** | The synthesizer who discerns the sense of the meeting. Not a chairperson - a listener. |
| **Voice / Perspective** | A participant in discernment. May be internal (simulated), agent (spawned), or human. |
| **Focus person** | In clearness committees, the person seeking clarity. Others serve their discernment. |

## Process Terms

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Convene** | Gather the relevant voices for discernment. Not "start a meeting" - deliberately bringing together who's needed. |
| **Discernment** | The process of seeking clarity through listening, not debating. |
| **Threshing** | Exploratory work before discernment - separating wheat from chaff, surfacing the landscape. |
| **Seasoning** | Letting something mature over time. Not rushing to decision. |
| **Sense of the meeting** | What the clerk discerns as the emerging unity - not a vote count. |

## Outcomes

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Unity** | Agreement that emerges from discernment. Not unanimity, not consensus, not compromise. |
| **Stand-aside** | Noted disagreement that doesn't block. "I wouldn't do this, but I trust the group." |
| **Block** | Principled objection that stops the process. Reserved for violations of core principles. |
| **Way opens** | Clarity emerges. The path forward becomes clear. |
| **Way doesn't open** | Clarity hasn't emerged. The matter needs more time, information, or reframing. |
| **Laid aside** | When way doesn't open, the matter is set aside for later. Not abandoned - deferred with intention. |

## Participant States

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Led to speak** | Feeling moved to contribute, not just wanting to talk. |
| **Nothing to add** | Genuine silence - having considered and finding nothing necessary to say. |
| **In unity** | Aligned with the emerging direction. No need to speak. |

## Quality of Process

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Gathered** | When participants are truly present and attending together. High-quality discernment. |
| **Weighty** | Important matters requiring deep consideration. Not casual questions. |
| **Corporate** | Of the body together. Corporate discernment = group discernment. |

## Anti-Terms (Don't Use)

| Avoid | Use instead | Why |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| Vote | Sense of the meeting | Voting is counting; sensing is listening |
| Decide | Discern | Deciding implies choice; discerning implies discovery |
| Compromise | Unity / Integration | Compromise loses; integration honors |
| Debate | Discernment | Debate is adversarial |
| Agree | Find unity | Agreement can be passive; unity is active |
| Chair | Clerk | Chairs run meetings; clerks serve discernment |
